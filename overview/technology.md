The presented system is delineated into two primary modules:

* An accurately trained AI model.
* A processing mechanism adapted for user requests within an AI consultant interface.



#### Extended Investment Opportunities <a href="#extended-investment-opportunities" id="extended-investment-opportunities"></a>

* Trading Platforms: Users have the flexibility to trade on both DEX (Decentralized Exchanges) and CEX (Centralized Exchanges).
* NFT Marketplaces: Interaction with NFT (Non-Fungible Token) marketplaces is facilitated, enabling users to buy, sell, or explore NFTs.
* Staking Programs: For those interested in further investment opportunities, staking programs are accessible to amplify potential returns.

While Open AI has been selected as our primary AI provider, the architecture of our system maintains inherent adaptability. This ensures seamless transitions to alternative AI providers, if a future need arises, preserving system functionality and integrity.

* User-Retail Interaction: This feature enables users to engage directly with retail brands via our AI consultant.
* Partner Cashback: Upon transactions, users benefit from partner cashback derived from the affiliated trading network.
