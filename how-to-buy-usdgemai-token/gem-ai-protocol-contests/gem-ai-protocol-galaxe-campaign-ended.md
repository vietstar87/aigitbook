# ðŸ”¥GEM AI Protocol Galaxe Campaign\[Ended]

**Here's how it works:** 100 lucky participants are randomly selected to receive $50 worth of $GEMAI or $DAO each.

Rewards earned from these campaigns will be dispersed in two equal increments over a period of two weeks. These rewards will be redeemed in $GEMAI, with their corresponding value determined by the stablecoin rate at the precise date of distribution. Winners will have to pass a KYC to claim their reward.

We highly recommend that participants keep a close eye on our updates for information about the campaign results and more. Your anticipation is greatly appreciated.

**Legal Disclaimer:**

The ensuing campaign is subject to these Terms & Conditions, including the following specific eligibility restrictions: participation is explicitly prohibited for citizens and residents of the United States, Canada, Tunisia, Qatar, Nepal, Morocco, Iraq, Egypt, China, Bangladesh, and Algeria. Any attempt by individuals from these jurisdictions to partake in the campaign will result in immediate disqualification.

In order to ensure compliance and maintain fairness, all winners must satisfactorily complete a Know Your Customer (KYC) verification process prior to being issued any prize. This includes providing truthful and accurate identification and contact information.

We reserve the right to disqualify any participant who we believe, in our sole discretion, to be engaging in dishonest practices, including but not limited to utilizing bot-generated activity, fabricating fake accounts, submitting false entries, or any other actions deemed to undermine the integrity of the campaign.

Upon being declared a winner, each participant has a 23-days grace period to complete this process.
