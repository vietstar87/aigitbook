# ðŸ”¥$20,000 Airdrop Campaign \[Ended]



**Here's how it works:** 1000 participants are randomly selected to receive $10 worth of $GEMAI each, and 500 participants to receive $10 worth of $CGPT each.

In addition, we're offering rewards for the top 50 referrers. The top referrer will receive $1500 worth of $GEM I, with the second and third-place referrers receiving $750 and $400 worth of $GEMAI, respectively. The remaining 47 referrers in the top 50 will receive $50 worth of $GGEMAI each.

Rewards earned from this campaign will be dispersed in three equal increments over a period of three months, with one-third of the total reward being made available for release each month. These rewards will be redeemed in $GEMAI and $CGPT tokens, with their corresponding value determined by the stablecoin rate at the precise date of distribution. Winners will have 7 days to pass a KYC & claim their reward.

We highly recommend that participants keep a close eye on our updates for information about the campaign results and more. Your anticipation is greatly appreciated.
