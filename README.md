# ðŸ‘‹Welcome to GEM AI



The team, originally founded in Ukraine, is now based in Europe and Asia. It consists of 45+ employees, with core team members collaborating for over 11+ years and began as a software development company, with a specific focus on blockchain and cryptocurrency development. In 2024, we launched an independent project - an application for crypto investment and trading, and quickly became an authorized partner of Binance. Now we are thrilled to unveil our brand new AI product, an all-inclusive crypto AI manager designed to revolutionize usersâ€™ crypto trading and investment experience.

Our AI assistant will interact with users via a highly sophisticated conversational interface, enabling it to: execute trades on both CEX and DEX platforms perform deep AI market analysis, optimize trading strategies, initiate automatic AI algorithmic trading, invest in crypto startups during IDO stages, purchase NFTs from promising collections and provide educational content tailored to each userâ€™s knowledge level

The GEM AI will be mentor for people by guiding them in the world of crypto and managing all their crypto investment deals through a conversational interface as easy as to talk to a friend.

One of the key features of our AI assistant will be to assist users with online purchases, finding the best-quality products with the most favorable delivery conditions and prices. Users will receive cashback in GTP tokens when making online purchases through our AI. This great approach will enable millions of users who have never dealt with cryptocurrencies to become participants in the market.

GEM AI removes barriers and risks associated with cryptocurrencies, making it accessible to users who have no technical knowledge, no trading accounts, KYC on CEXes or special expertise.

With 2.14 billion people making at least one online purchase in 2024, the online retail market purchases is huge. We are aiming to attract 100,000,000 users to the market by 2027. Are you ready to join us on this journey?
